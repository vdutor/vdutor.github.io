I am also part-time affiliated to Secondmind, where I fulfil the role of senior machine learning researcher. I was fortunate to spend the second half of 2022 doing an internship at DeepMind, where I was part of the Safety Analysis team.\nMy research interests lie in probabilistic machine learning with applications in generative modelling and sequential decision making. - Gaussian processes - Deep Generative modelling - Stochastic Differential Equations.\nBesides my research, I love developing full-stack data-centric projects."
