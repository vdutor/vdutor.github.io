Hi! I'm Vincent Dutordoir, a PhD student in Probabilistic Machine Learning at the University of Cambridge, working with professor [Zoubin Ghahramani](https://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin/) and [Carl Henrik Ek](http://carlhenrik.com/). 

Prior to my PhD, I worked for a couple of years at [Secondmind](https://www.secondmind.ai/) as a machine learning researcher. I'm still affiliated to Secondmind on a part-time basis since starting my PhD. In fall 2022, I did an internship at [DeepMind](https://www.deepmind.com/).

My research focuses on the intersection of statistical methods and deep learning, with applications in generative modelling and sequential decision making. Recently, I have been excited about defining [stochastic processes using denoising diffusion models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03992).

Besides my research, I love developing fullstack (data-centric) applications, and I help maintain a couple of opensource projects: [1](https://github.com/GPflow/GeometricKernels), [2](https://github.com/vdutor/fluid), [3](https://github.com/secondmind-labs/GPflux).
