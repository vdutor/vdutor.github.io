:::{#hero-heading}

I am a PhD Candidate in Information Engineering at the University of Cambridge, working with professor [Zoubin Ghahramani](https://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin/) and [Carl Henrik Ek](http://carlhenrik.com/). I am also part-time affiliated to [Secondmind](https://www.secondmind.ai/), where I fulfil the role of senior machine learning researcher. I was fortunate to spend the second half of 2022 doing an internship at [DeepMind](https://www.deepmind.com/), where I was part of the Safety Analysis team.

My research interests lie in probabilistic machine learning with applications in generative modelling and sequential decision making.
- Gaussian processes
- Deep Generative modelling
- Stochastic Differential Equations.

Besides my research, I love developing full-stack data-centric projects.
