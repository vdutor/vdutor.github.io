{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Hello and welcome to my webspace! I am a senior machine learning researcher at <a href=https://www.secondmind.ai/> Secondmind</a> (formerly PROWLER.io), undertaking a PhD in probabilistic machine learning at the University of Cambridge, under the supervision of <a href=http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin>prof. Zoubin Ghahramani</a>.</p>\n<p>I work on the development of probabilistic machine learning models for autonomous decision-making in dynamic and uncertain environments, like volatility prediction in financial markets or demand planning in supply chain networks. In most of my work, I follow Bayesian principles as it provides a principled way of building robust models that can safely be deployed in complex environments where data is typically scarce and noisy.</p>\n<p>I'm particularly interested in Gaussian processes (GPs), and over the last couple of years, I have done research in adding more sophisticated model structures into the GP, like depth, convolutions and latent variables â€“ leading to models that are both practically useful and probabilistically grounded.</p>"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"twitter":"https://twitter.com/vdutor","github":"https://github.com/vdutor","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/vdutor"}}}}
