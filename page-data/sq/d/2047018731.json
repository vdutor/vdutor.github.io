This has limited their applicability in certain tasks (e.g. image classification). \n  We propose a translation insensitive convolutional kernel, which relaxes the translation invariance constraint imposed by previous convolutional GPs.\n  We show how we can use the marginal likelihood to learn the degree of insensitivity. We also reformulate GP image-to-image convolutional mappings as multi-output GPs,\n  leading to deep convolutional GPs. We show experimentally that our new kernel improves performance in both single-layer and deep models.\n  We also demonstrate that our fully Bayesian approach improves on dropout-based Bayesian deep learning methods in terms of uncertainty and marginal likelihood estimates.} \n}","pdf":"http://proceedings.mlr.press/v108/dutordoir20a/dutordoir20a.pdf","url":"http://proceedings.mlr.press/v108/dutordoir20a.html"}},{"node":{"key":"salimbeni19a","title":"Deep Gaussian Processes with Importance-Weighted Variational Inference","authors":["Hugh Salimbeni","Vincent Dutordoir","James Hensman","Marc Deisenroth"],"author":"Salimbeni, Hugh and Dutordoir, Vincent and Hensman, James and Deisenroth, Marc","booktitle":"International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)","year":"2019","raw":"@InProceedings{salimbeni19a,\n title = {Deep Gaussian Processes with Importance-Weighted Variational Inference},\n author = {Salimbeni, Hugh and Dutordoir, Vincent and Hensman, James and Deisenroth, Marc},\n booktitle={International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)},\n pages = {5589--5598},\n year = {2019},\n editor = {Kamalika Chaudhuri and Ruslan Salakhutdinov},\n volume = {97},\n series = {Proceedings of Machine Learning Research},\n address = {Long Beach, California, USA},\n month = {09--15 Jun},\n publisher = {PMLR},\n pdf = {http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/salimbeni19a/salimbeni19a.pdf},\n url = {http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/salimbeni19a.html},\n abstract = {Deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) can model complex marginal densities as well as complex mappings.\n Non-Gaussian marginals are essential for modelling real-world data, and can be generated from the DGP by incorporating uncorrelated variables to the model. \n Previous work in the DGP model has introduced noise additively, and used variational inference with a combination of sparse Gaussian processes and mean-field Gaussians for the approximate posterior.\n Additive noise attenuates the signal, and the Gaussian form of variational distribution may lead to an inaccurate posterior.\n We instead incorporate noisy variables as latent covariates, and propose a novel importance-weighted objective, which leverages analytic results and provides a mechanism to trade off computation for improved accuracy.\n Our results demonstrate that the importance-weighted objective works well in practice and consistently outperforms classical variational inference, especially for deeper models.} \n }","pdf":"http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/salimbeni19a/salimbeni19a.pdf","url":"http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/salimbeni19a.html"}},{"node":{"key":"dutordoir2018gaussian","title":"Gaussian Process Conditional Density Estimation","authors":["Vincent Dutordoir","Hugh Salimbeni","James Hensman","Marc Deisenroth"],"author":"Dutordoir, Vincent and Salimbeni, Hugh and Hensman, James and Deisenroth, Marc","booktitle":"Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 31","year":"2018","raw":"@incollection{dutordoir2018gaussian,\ntitle = {Gaussian Process Conditional Density Estimation},\nauthor = {Dutordoir, Vincent and Salimbeni, Hugh and Hensman, James and Deisenroth, Marc},\nbooktitle = {Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 31},\neditor = {S.
