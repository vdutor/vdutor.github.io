Hello and welcome to my webspace! I am a senior machine learning researcher at <a href=https://www.secondmind.ai/> Secondmind</a> (formerly PROWLER.io), undertaking a PhD in probabilistic machine learning at the University of Cambridge, under the supervision of <a href=http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin>prof. Zoubin Ghahramani</a>.

I work on the development of probabilistic machine learning models for autonomous decision-making in dynamic and uncertain environments, like volatility prediction in financial markets or demand planning in supply chain networks. In most of my work, I follow Bayesian principles as it provides a principled way of building robust models that can safely be deployed in complex environments where data is typically scarce and noisy.

I'm particularly interested in Gaussian processes (GPs), and over the last couple of years, I have done research in adding more sophisticated model structures into the GP, like depth, convolutions and latent variables &ndash; leading to models that are both practically useful and probabilistically grounded.
